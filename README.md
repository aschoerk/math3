What is this Project
====================

I do something here just because I want to get an impression how something realistic previously implemented in Java can be done 
in Rust.
There is this much copyright, the origin is apache code, but don't expect this to be usable for any purposes.
A partial Rewrite of a non trivial java-module in Rust. Not usable for production purposes!


Apache Commons Math
===================

The Apache Commons Math project is a library of lightweight, self-contained mathematics and statistics components addressing the most common practical problems not immediately available in the Java programming language or commons-lang.
